Creation of tables.
Preparation and insertion of data.
2025-03-10. Addition of departments to the goals of the company. Currently, the concept of departments is not introduced to the goals of the company. On the one hand, I don't think this concept should help me to maintain the system of goals, at least regarding its current complexity. On the other hand, it might help others in two ways. First, it might help them not to get lost so much. Second, they might familiarize with the goals more, as the concept of departments is known well.
2025-03-10. Updating the script `split-labels-contents.awk` so that it keeps numbers together with the preceding word. Currently the numbers are treated as an ordinary word, thus moved to the next line if needed, specifically always when they are equal to or less than 3 characters. For readability they should never be moved. For the sake of simplicity, their length should not matter.
Improvement of performance of data insertion. Currently, the data generation and insertion takes too much time, possibly due to many "insert" commands being executed. A solution might be to execute less of them. It might be worth to have a look at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69408478/postgres-inserting-as-many-rows-as-a-value-on-another-table, the function "generate_series" (https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/functions-srf.html), the function "unnest" (https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/sql-select.html), and the possiblities of the command "insert" (https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/sql-insert.html).
2025-03-21. "number_of_parcels_in_transit"'s being greater than "total_number_of_parcels" bug.
