On the one hand, I don't think this concept should help me to maintain the system of goals, at least regarding its current complexity. On the other hand, it might help others in two ways. First, it might help them not to get lost so much. Second, they might familiarize with the goals more, as the concept of departments is known well.

Currently the numbers are treated as an ordinary word, thus moved to the next line if needed, specifically always when they are equal to or less than 3 characters. For readability they should never be moved. For the sake of simplicity, their length should not matter.
