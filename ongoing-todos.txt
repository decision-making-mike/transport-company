TODO'S CREATION DATE. TITLE. DESCRIPTION.
Improvement of performance of data insertion. Currently, the data generation and insertion takes too much time, possibly due to many "insert" commands being executed. A solution might be to execute less of them. It might be worth to have a look at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69408478/postgres-inserting-as-many-rows-as-a-value-on-another-table, the function "generate_series" (https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/functions-srf.html), the function "unnest" (https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/sql-select.html), and the possiblities of the command "insert" (https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/sql-insert.html).
