TODO'S CREATION DATE. TITLE. DESCRIPTION.
Improvement of performance of data insertion. Currently, the data generation and insertion takes too much time, possibly due to many "insert" commands being executed. A solution might be to execute less of them. It might be worth to have a look at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69408478/postgres-inserting-as-many-rows-as-a-value-on-another-table, the function "generate_series" (https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/functions-srf.html), the function "unnest" (https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/sql-select.html), and the possiblities of the command "insert" (https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/sql-insert.html).
2025-03-10. Updating the script `split-labels-contents.awk` so that it keeps numbers together with the preceding word. Currently the numbers are treated as an ordinary word, thus moved to the next line if needed, specifically always when they are equal to or less than 3 characters. For readability they should never be moved. For the sake of simplicity, their length should not matter.
